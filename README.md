## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Audrey. 
I am a maker & full stack developer with a background in design, social innovation and business.

Graduated from Le Wagon web development bootcamp in 2024, I would love to contribute to web projects with a sustainable & ethical design approach.

In 2021, I co-founded the collective Slow lab in which we design experiences and low-tech artefacts to create new imaginaries and question our dependency to technology.
